# zsimple
Simple, modern, fast zsh environment.

## Features
- Modern feel with quality of life features while keeping things simple and fast
- Works on Linux, MacOS and some Windows environments
- No plugin manager (tries system paths first, otherwise asks if to git clone)
- Only 3 (very audited) plugins: zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting

## Install

Please run `install.sh` with bash or zsh.  
Make sure to review the contents of ~/.aliases and ~/.exports afterwards to customize to your liking.  
It will backup any existing files called `.zshrc`, `.exports` and `.aliases`.  
Please also keep your own backups of dotfiles as well.
